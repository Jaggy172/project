<h2>Basic information.</h2>
I'm from London and currently study in Dundee university.

<h2>Interests.</h2>
I am a <a href='studies.html'>Mathematical Biology</a> student with a broad range of interests including <i>Latin American history, existential philosophy and folk music</i>

<h2>Three books I recommend</h2>

<ol>
    <li><b>The Science Delusion</b></li> 
By Rupert Sheldrake. Eccentric Oxford qualified biologist challenges the validity of some common dogmas in physics and biology ranging from whether or not atoms are alive and are proteins really only determined by genes. Funny book but best not to take it too seriously.
   
 <li><b>Guns, Germs and Steel</b></li>
By Jared Diamond, a heavy weight in human anthropology. Diamond attempts to answer the question why were European civilisations more progressive than other civilisations in the world in developing technology and imperialism? The whole book can be summed up into two words: Environmental Determinism.

    <li><b>Poisonwood bible</b></li>
By Barbara Kingsolver. A novel set in the Belgian Congo where an American missionary family move to in order to spread their branch of fundamental Christianity. The cultural clash eventually tears the family apart. Probably my favourite novel to date
