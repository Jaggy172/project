<h3>List of interesting books I enjoy<h3>
<ol>
    <li>The Science Delusion</li> 
By Rupert Sheldrake. Eccentric Oxford qualified biologist challenges the validity of strong common dogmas in physics and biology ranging from whether or not atoms are alive and are proteins really only determined by genes. Funny book but best not to take it too seriously.
    <li>Guns, Germs and Steel<li>
By Jared Diamond, a heavy weight in human anthropology. Diamond attempts to answer the question why were European civilisations more progressive than other civilisations  in developing technology and imperialism? The whole book can be summed up into two words: Environmental Determinism.
    <li>Poisonwood bible<li>
By Barbara Kingsolver. A novel set in the Belgian Congo where an American missionary family move to in order to spread their branch of fundamental Christianity. The cultural clash eventually tears the family apart. Probably my favourite fiction.
